# Personal Project: *Aquarium*

## Introduction

Aquarium is a game that allows you to collect new sea creatures by earning experience points! To earn experience points,
you feed your existing sea creatures treats. Playing with sea creatures earns an amount of sea dollars randomly 
generated from within a pre-set interval. Once a sea creature is hungry, you must buy them food to play with them again!
By feeding sea creatures treats, you both reset their hunger and earn experience points. New sea creatures are unlocked
once you've gained a certain number of experience points, and are then automatically added to your tank. The order of
sea creatures is goldfish, then jellyfish, stingray, whale shark, and finally shark. Play to unlock them all!
